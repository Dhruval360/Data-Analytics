# DengAI - Analysing the Effects of Climate on the Spread of Dengue
An accurate model to predict possible outbreaks of Dengue Fever enables a nation to equip itself in the fightagainst the disease. In this study,  we present a model capable of forecasting the emergence of Dengue cases. With the help of statistical and analytical techniques we gain insight into how the weather conditions and vegetation of a region affects the number of Dengue cases reported, enabling our model to performaccurate predictions about the outbreaks. These predictions would serve as an early warning estimate.
